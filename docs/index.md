# Overview

in pure HTML5/canvas. Interactive here means that you can attach handlers
for different type of events, like click, mouseover, mouseout etc.

features does not yet fully cover all existing musical symbols.

# Basic structure
The main idea about Euterpe design is purely visual approach.
That is the music score is composed from a visual point of view, not
from the musical theory one. We'll talk about this approach in details later
but for now it is sufficient to know, that you are not required to have solid
knowledge of musical theory in order to understand and use the Euterpe library.
